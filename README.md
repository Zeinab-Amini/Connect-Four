# Connect-Four
In this project, I use te libraries, numpy, pygame, sys and, math. 
A lot of the code is about how to show each piece. 
And the other the rest of it is about how to win. 
When you run the code, you will see a chart and when you click on any circles, it will show a red dott in that circle that you choose.
Then next dott will be yellow for the next player. 
If you put two dotts in the same row, the new piece will go on top of the prevouis dott.
Which ever color gets four dotts in a row will win.
